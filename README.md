## What is Hearmes?

Hearmes is a proposed distribution system for stories shared by migrants and refugees to credible media outlets.
It was our project for VHacks 2018.

## What does Hearmes do? How does it work?

Submitting a story is as easy as handwriting it and scanning to upload, where a computer vision API converts the image to text format. Using natural language processing, our system extracts keywords relevant to the story and also determines, through a proprietary method, the most compelling phrase in the story that can be placed into related content throughout the web. 
Supporting websites can search through our code for keywords relevant to their content and obtain an HTML snippet that is easily embedable. Here is an example - as a jazz enthusiast, I’m reading a recent review in a prominent newspaper, when I stumble upon this attention-grabbing quote. I’m driven to click to read more, and just like that I’ve had a moment of connection with a migrant in my area!
